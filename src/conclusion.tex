\section{Conclusion}\label{section:conclusion}
In this work, we propose Cassiopeia, a social Witness Encryption scheme instantiated as an on-chain smart contract, along with an incentivized version of the scheme.
Our construction combines a publicly verifiable secret sharing scheme and zkSNARKs to provide security against malleability attacks.
In doing so, the scheme is also resistant to front-running attacks which are widespread when interacting with smart contracts.
We also provide a Solidity smart contract implementation of the non-incentivized scheme.
The non-incentivized construction is correct and secure under honest majority, and the incentivized construction is correct under rational majority.

Future work will focus on ensuring security for the incentivized scheme under rational majority.
Threshold Information Escrows have been proposed with incentivized security~\cite{watermarking_ot}, and could potentially be integrated with our work.
Furthermore, we could also allow for a dynamic committee by using proactive secret sharing, which would make our protocol more robust to security attacks.
