\section{Analysis}
We assume a synchronous network model where there exists a probablistic polynomial time adversary.
The adversarial controls some committee members, which can do whatever they like.
\begin{definition}{Social Witness Encryption Correctness.}
    Suppose an honest dealer runs Algorithm \ref{dealer_alg_no_incentives} for a message $m$ and an instance $x$ for a relation $\mathcal{R}$.
    The Social Witness Encryption protocol is correct if $m$ can be obtained in finite time after a valid witness $w$ is provided for decryption.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}\label{correctness_hm}
    Consider an honest dealer, and a committee of size $n$ such that at least $t$ are honest.
    Let \textsf{PVSS} = (\textsf{genDist}, \textsf{verifyDist}, \textsf{decrypt}, \textsf{verifyShare}, \textsf{reconstruct}) be a correct PVSS scheme,
    $(G, P, V)$ be a correct zkSNARK scheme, $(Enc, Dec)$ be a correct symmetric encryption scheme,
    $\mathbb{L}$ be a safe and live ledger, and $H$ be a random oracle.
    The Social Witness Encryption construction in Algorithm \ref{cassiopeia_no_incentives} with respect to \textsf{PVSS}, $(G, P, V)$, $(Enc, Dec)$, $\mathbb{L}$ and $H$ is correct.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By the correctness of PVSS, an honestly generated PVSS ciphertext $c$ using \textsf{PVSS.genDist} will always pass verification under \textsf{PVSS.verifyDist}.
    Since $H$ is a random oracle, the identifier $id$ generated by the contract is unique to the ciphertext and the instance and $y$ is deterministic.
    Furthermore, since the dealer knows the secret $s$ and the zkSNARK is correct, the honestly generated proof $\pi$ will pass verification under $V$. 
    Since $\mathbb{L}$ is both safe and live, the dealer's transaction calling \textsf{encrypt} will be confirmed in a finite number of blocks, and the values $c, \mathcal{R}, x$ are committed to the ledger state.
    Furthermore, safety and liveness of $\mathbb{L}$ means a transaction calling \textsf{claim} is only confirmed if the witness $w$ is valid for the instance $x$ of $\mathcal{R}$.

    By the correctness of PVSS and honesty of the dealer, an honest committee member $i$ who calls $\textsf{PVSS.decrypt}(\hat{s}_i, sk_i)$ obtains $s_i' = s_i$.
    Therefore, at least $t$ committee members will call \textsf{submitShare} for secret $id$ with valid decrypted shares $s_i'$ within $\Delta$ blocks of \textsf{claim} because at least $t$ committee members are honest.
    Furthermore, \textsf{PVSS.verifyShare} will always pass since $s_i' = s_i$.
    By the safety and liveness of $\mathbb{L}$, every honest committee member's transaction calling \textsf{submitShare} will be confirmed in a finite number of blocks, and $s_i'$ is committed to the ledger state as $S_{id,i}$.
    Therefore, the state $S_{id}$ on $\mathbb{L}$ contains at least $t$ elements of $\{s_1, \dots, s_n\}$.
    By the correctness of PVSS, $\textsf{reconstruct}(S_{id}) = s$.
    By the correctness of the symmetric encryption scheme, $Dec_s(\hat{c}) = m$.
    Therefore, $m$ is obtained in finite time after a valid witness $w$ is presented, and the scheme is correct.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
    Consider an honest dealer, and a committee of size $n$ such that at least $t$ are rational.
    Assume there exists a fixed per-block risk-free rate $r$.
    The construction with respect to \textsf{PVSS}, $(G, P, V)$, $(Enc, Dec)$, $\mathbb{L}$, $H$, and $r$ is correct.
\end{theorem}
\begin{lemma}
    If an honest committee member is honest, their net compensation is positive.

    The smart contract contains sufficient funds to pay the reparation fee to the beneficiaries to all active secrets at all times.
