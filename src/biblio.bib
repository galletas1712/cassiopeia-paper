  abstract  = {Previously known techniques to construct pairing-friendly curves of prime or near-prime order are restricted to embedding degree \$k {\textbackslash}backslashleqslant 6 \$. More general methods produce curves over \$\{{\textbackslash}backslashmathbb F\}\_\{p\}\$where the bit length of p is often twice as large as that of the order r of the subgroup with embedding degree k; the best published results achieve ρ ≡ log(p)/log(r) {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 5/4. In this paper we make the first step towards surpassing these limitations by describing a method to construct elliptic curves of prime order and embedding degree k = 12. The new curves lead to very efficient implementation: non-pairing operations need no more than \$\{{\textbackslash}backslashmathbb F\}\_\{p{\textasciicircum}4\}\$arithmetic, and pairing values can be compressed to one third of their length in a way compatible with point reduction techniques. We also discuss the role of large CM discriminants D to minimize ρ; in particular, for embedding degree k = 2q where q is prime we show that the ability to handle log(D)/log(r) {\textbackslash}textasciitilde (q–3)/(q–1) enables building curves with ρ {\textbackslash}textasciitilde q/(q–1).},

  title     = {Poseidon: A New Hash Function for Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems},
  abstract  = {The area of practical computational integrity proof systems, like SNARKs, STARKs, Bulletproofs, is seeing a very dynamic development with several constructions having appeared recently with improved properties and relaxed setup requirements. Many use cases of such systems involve, often as their most expensive part, proving the knowledge of a preimage under a certain cryptographic hash function, which is expressed as a circuit over a large prime field. A notable example is a zero-knowledge proof of coin ownership in the Zcash cryptocurrency, where the inadequacy of the SHA-256 hash function for such a circuit caused a huge computational penalty. In this paper, we present a modular framework and concrete instances of cryptographic hash functions which work natively with GF(p) objects. Our hash function POSEIDON uses up to 8x fewer constraints per message bit than Pedersen Hash. Our construction is not only expressed compactly as a circuit, but can also be tailored for various proof systems using specially crafted polynomials, thus bringing another boost in performance. We demonstrate this by implementing a 1-out-of-a-billion membership proof with Merkle trees in less than a second by using Bulletproofs.},
