Witness Encryption is a holy grail of cryptography that remains elusive.
It asks that a secret is only revealed when a particular computational problem is solved.
Modern smart contracts and blockchains make assumptions of ``honest majority'', which allow for a \emph{social} implementation of Witness Encryption.
The core idea is to make use of a partially trusted committee to carry out the responsibilities mandated by these functionalities â€“ such as keeping the secret private, and then releasing it publicly after a solution to the computational puzzle is presented.
We implement Witness Encryption (with public witness security) in the form of an open source composable smart contract that can be utilized as an oracle by others within the broader DeFi ecosystem.
We analyze its security under an honest majority setting and devise a cryptoeconomic scheme to incentivise honest participation. % what about rational majority?
We conclude by measuring and optimizing gas costs and illustrating the practicality of our scheme.
