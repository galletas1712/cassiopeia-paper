\paragraph{Construction Overview.}
Suppose Alice wants to encrypt a secret with an instance of a puzzle.
Alice will entrust a fixed committee to keep her secret and release it if someone presents a solution to the puzzle to the smart contract.
Alice trusts that at a majority of this committee are honest.
Alice splits her secret into shares, one for each committee member, such that a majority of them are required to reconstruct the original secret.
She encrypts each share such that only the committee member the share was intended for can decrypt it.
Alice then calls a smart contract function to publish the encrypted shares for them to access.
The contract verifies that Alice split her secret into shares correctly.
When the contract receives a solution to the puzzle, it enables committee members to submit their decrypted share to the contract.
When a committee member submits a share, the contract verifies that it is consistent with the corresponding encrypted share Alice posted before accepting the share.
As long as at least a majority of the committee members revealed their shares, Alice's secret can be reconstructed by anyone.
