\paragraph{Our Contributions.} We summarize our contributions as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We put forth a smart contract-based construction for Witness Encryption.
    \item We explore whether our scheme is correct and secure under the honest majority and rational majority settings.
    \item We implement the construction as an open-source Solidity smart contract, benchmark gas usage on Ethereum, and provide our parameterization of the scheme.
\end{enumerate}

Traditionally Witness Encryption schemes require the witness to remain private during decryption.
However, in many practical use cases, a public witness is useful as the secret does not remain hidden.
We focus on constructing Witness Encryption with public witness security, but it is possible to extend our scheme to support private decryption.
