\paragraph{Applications.}
WE can be used to build powerful cryptographic primitives such as succinct Functional Encryption~\cite{functional_encryption} for Turing machines~\cite{turing_machine_fe}.
When combined with a blockchain, WE can also be leveraged to achieve fairness against dishonest majority in a secure multi-party computation protocol~\cite{we_mpc_fairness}.
