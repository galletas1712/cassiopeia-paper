\subsection{Witness Encryption}
    In a Witness Encryption scheme, a message is encrypted such that the ciphertext can only be decrypted if a witness is presented as a solution to an NP problem~\cite{witness_encryption}.
    For example, a message can be encrypted such that it can only be decrypted with a solution to an instance of the 3-SAT problem.
    Concretely, let $\mathcal{R}$ be a relation of an NP language $\mathcal{L}$ such that for each $x \in \mathcal{L}$, there exists some $w$ such that $(x, w) \in \mathcal{R}$ and for all $x \notin \mathcal{L}$ such a witness does not exist.
    A Witness Encryption scheme, parameterized by a security parameter $\lambda$, consists of the encryption and decryption functions $\textsf{WE.Enc}_\mathcal{R}(1^{\lambda}, x, m)$ and $\textsf{WE.Dec}_\mathcal{R}(c, w)$ such that the following properties hold~\cite{timelock_from_crc}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Correctness}: For any plaintext message $m$, instance $x \in \mathcal{L}$, and witness $w$ such that $(x, w) \in \mathcal{R}$, $\textsf{WE.Dec}_\mathcal{R}(\textsf{WE.Enc}_\mathcal{R}(1^{\lambda}, x, m), w) = m$.
        \item \emph{Security}: A PPT adversary given $c = \textsf{WE.Enc}_\mathcal{R}(1^{\lambda}, x, m)$ is only able to extract information about $m$ if she can also produce a witness $w$ such that $(x, w) \in \mathcal{R}$, except with negligible probability.
    \end{itemize}
    The scheme has public witness security if the witness is public during decryption, and the message is revealed publicly.
    This definition does not yet encompass extractability and the social aspect of our scheme, and is a precursor to the definition of Extractable Social Witness Encryption we introduce later in the paper.
