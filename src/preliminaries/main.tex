	% \subsection{Timelock Encryption} % TODO: write this up
 %    In the standard model, TE is implemented either through time-lock puzzles~\cite{timed_release_cryptography,timelock_puzzles}, which are computationally-heavy puzzles that cannot be completed without running for a certain amount of time.
 %    However, blockchains provide a common reference clock that can be leveraged as a source of truth for how much time has passed, and can be combined with extractable WE to build TE~\cite{timelock_from_crc}.
 %    An efficient extractable WE scheme would therefore allow TE (and Functional Encryption as well) to be practical.
