\section{Preliminaries}
    \subsection{Symmetric Encryption}
    Let $s$ be the secret key and $m$ be the message to encrypt.
    A symmetric encryption scheme contains an encryption algorithm and a decryption algorithm.
    The encryption algorithm encrypts the message $m$ with the secret key $s$ to produce the ciphertext $c = Enc_s(m)$.
    The decryption algorithm decrypts the ciphertext $c$ with the secret key $s$ to produce the message $m = Dec_s(c)$.

    \subsection{Risk-Free Rate}
    Our protocol assumes there exists a per-block risk-free rate $r$ that is agreed upon by all parties participating in the protocol.
    We assume there exists an exogenous risk-free source of yield.
    For every block, anyone can deposit $M$ and earn $M(1 + r)$ after one block.
    The rate $r$ is does not change across time.
    The oppportunity cost for not earning risk-free yield on $M$ for $k$ blocks is $M(1 + r)^k - M$.

	% \subsection{Timelock Encryption} % TODO: write this up
 %    In the standard model, TE is implemented either through time-lock puzzles~\cite{timed_release_cryptography,timelock_puzzles}, which are computationally-heavy puzzles that cannot be completed without running for a certain amount of time.
 %    However, blockchains provide a common reference clock that can be leveraged as a source of truth for how much time has passed, and can be combined with extractable WE to build TE~\cite{timelock_from_crc}.
 %    An efficient extractable WE scheme would therefore allow TE (and Functional Encryption as well) to be practical.
