\subsection{Secret Sharing}
A threshold secret sharing scheme~\cite{shamir_ss}, consists of a dealer $D$, a secret $s$, a committee of $n$ participants $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$, and a threshold $t$.
To share the secret, $D$ calls a function $\textsf{share}(s)$ which splits $s$ into shares $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ and distributes these to participants such that each participant $p_i$ only has access to $s_i$.
If any set of at least $t$ participants work together to combine their shares $s_{i_1}, s_{i_2}, \dots$, these can be passed to a function $\textsf{recover}(s_{i_1}, s_{i_2}, \dots)$ to obtain the original secret.
On the other hand, if less than $t$ participants work together to combine their shares, the secret will be recovered with negligible probability.
